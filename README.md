# Fuzzy-Logic-in-Image-Processing-
Author- Mayuri H. Parkhe
Image processing using Fuzzy Logic, we have used a collection of different fuzzy approaches for image processing.
Fuzzy image processing is the collection of all approaches that understand, represent, and process the images, their segments, and features as fuzzy sets.
we have used medical images like CT Scan and MRI. 
These biomedical images are being used within the healthcare facilities for patient diagnosis, guiding treatment, planning treatment, and observing illness progression. 
Medical imaging basically processes missing, uncertain, complementary, ambiguous, inconsistent, and distorted data.
